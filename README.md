##Design ![pokémonopoly](images/bulbasaur.png)
I designed the board to have a similar look and feel to the classic Monopoly board, but I added my own personal touch as well. I tried to keep it as clean and simple as I could because there is a lot of data, and I didn't want to overwhelm the players with too many colors and flashy animations.

##![pokémonopoly](images/charmander.png)Get Started
Each player must enter his/her name in the text box before clicking the "Start Game" button. Once the game starts, players switch turns by clicking the "Roll" button, and following the directions in a notification box that appears after each roll. A player loses when his/her money total drops below $0.
